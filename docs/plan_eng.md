# Investie Development Plan - Vibe Coding Approach

## ðŸŽ¯ Development Strategy
- **Vibe Coding**: Establish overall structure first, then incrementally develop feature by feature
- **Frontend First**: Complete UI first for immediate visual feedback

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria for Each Step

### âœ… Checklist for Each Step Completion
1. **Visual Confirmation**: Feature works normally in UI
2. **Independence**: Functions without depending on other features
3. **Reusability**: Structure that can be utilized in next steps
4. **Scalability**: Structure that allows easy addition of features

### ðŸ”„ Iterative Development Cycle
For each step:
1. **Plan** â†’ 2. **Implement** â†’ 3. **Test** â†’ 4. **Verify** â†’ 5. **Next Step**

### ðŸ“± Immediate Feedback Principle
- Run app at every step to verify results
- Verify that changes are immediately reflected in UI
- Fix immediately when problems occur before proceeding

Following this plan, you can complete the final MVP by adding one working feature at each step. Each step is designed to be independent while functioning as part of the overall project.

## ðŸš€ Development Order Logic

1. **Foundation (Steps 1-2)**: Basic structure and tooling setup
2. **UI Components (Steps 2-3)**: Reusable UI components
3. **First Feature (Step 3)**: Establish overall pattern with Market Summary Card
4. **Iterative Development (Steps 4-5)**: Add Stock Cards one by one
5. **Real Data (Step 6)**: Transition from mock to real APIs
6. **Advanced Features (Steps 7-8)**: Authentication, personalization, optimization
7. **Deployment (Steps 9-10)**: Backend and app store deployment

This approach ensures daily progress visibility and maintains a working app at all times. Which step would you like to start with?
